## About Me

Frontend-focused developer based in Bergen with a background in structured systems work and logistics operations.

I enjoy building modular, maintainable UI systems and exploring frontend architecture that scales.  
Currently deep-diving into Vue 3 and TypeScript, with a strong interest in real-time applications and complex systems.

I actively use AI tools to accelerate prototyping, testing ideas, and reasoning about architecture.
